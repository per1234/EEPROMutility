EEPROMutility
==========

[Arduino](http://arduino.cc) sketch for EEPROM management via the Serial Monitor. Allows reading and writing of any data type and testing. EEPROM is a type of memory whose values are kept when the board is turned off or a new sketch is uploaded. For more information about using EEPROM on Arduino see: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM

#### Instructions
- Download the most recent version of EEPROMutility here: https://github.com/per1234/EEPROMutility/archive/master.zip
- Extract the EEPROMutility-master folder from the downloaded zip file.
- Move the folder to a convenient location.
- If you are using an Arduino IDE version prior to 1.6.2 then you will need to install the EEPROM v2.0 library from here: https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/ide-1.5.x/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/EEPROM If you are using Arduino IDE version 1.6.2 or greater then the library is already installed.
- Open EEPROMutility/EEPROMutility.ino in the Arduino IDE.
- Upload the sketch to your device.
- Open the Serial Monitor(magnifying glass button in the top right of the Arduino IDE window).
- Select **9600 baud** in the menu in the lower right of the Serial Monitor window.
- Further help is available via the Serial Monitor interface.
